# Fake Detect Front-end Codebase

This repo has the code for the front-end app of Fake Profile Detection AIML minor project. The front-end is built by `React` & `React-Bootstrap`.

Pages:

`Predict`: Takes 8 numbers form users, and makes a post request to the backend, to retrieve a single predicted binary outcome.

### Additions:

1. Edit categorical form (gender, location, links) etc, from numerical to categorical. The user shoulb be able to input 'Male' or 'Female' for Gender input for instance. But the data to be sent to the backend must be 0 or 1.
2. Add another option to test with a `test.csv` file. Show predictions generated by the model at the backend.

`Dataset`: Displays the training dataset of the model.

`Graph`: Displays the training-accuracy & loss graph.
